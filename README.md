### Simplifications and compromises due to the time constraints (2-3 hours) and the scope of the exercise:

* Input Validation: Additional input validation to ensure that names and email formats are valid should be added.

* Error Handling: I kept error handling simple, primarily using print statements to indicate errors or warnings. In a real-world application, more robust error handling mechanisms, such as exceptions, would be necessary to handle edge cases and unexpected behaviors gracefully.

* Scalability and Performance: As the number of meetings and participants grows, the current implementation may face performance issues. Optimising data structures or implementation of more efficient algorithms, especially for operations like suggesting timeslots, should be considered.

* Timezone Handling: Application currently relies on the system's default timezone. If deployed in a production environment where users may be in different timezones, timezone handling should be considered.

* Data Persistence: I didn't include any data persistence mechanism such as storing data in files or databases. In a production application, data persistence would be crucial for maintaining state across sessions.
